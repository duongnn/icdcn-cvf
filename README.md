# icdcn-cvf
source code and experiment data for ICDCN'23 paper

Note:
We have developed this program as a generic toolset so that by only coding the specific algorithm, one can obtain the effect of cvf on that program. 
Specifically, our analysis of \mrank and \arank uses program transitions as a parameter. Thus, by simply specifying the new program transitions, one can analyze 
the effect of cvfs for the given program. 

Todo: we will add a tutorial on how to add an algorithm to the framework.
